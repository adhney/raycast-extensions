# SDK Migration Summary

## Current Implementation Status

### SDK vs REST API Usage

Due to compatibility issues with some Google Cloud SDKs in the Raycast environment, we're using a hybrid approach:

- **Storage Buckets** (`storage-buckets.tsx`)
  - ✅ Uses `@google-cloud/storage` SDK
  - Works perfectly with SDK

- **Cloud Functions** (`cloud-functions.tsx`)
  - ✅ Uses `@google-cloud/functions` SDK
  - Works well with parallel region checking

- **Compute Instances** (`compute-instances.tsx`)
  - ⚠️ Uses REST API
  - The `@google-cloud/compute` SDK causes "Connection interrupted" errors in Raycast
  - REST API implementation is stable and working

- **Cloud Run Services** (`cloud-run-services.tsx`)
  - ⚠️ Uses REST API
  - The `@google-cloud/run` SDK has compatibility issues with Raycast
  - REST API provides reliable results

### Why Some Components Use REST API

The Raycast extension environment has specific constraints that can cause issues with certain Google Cloud SDKs:

1. **gRPC Dependencies**: Some SDKs (like Compute and Cloud Run) rely on gRPC, which may not be fully compatible with Raycast's runtime
2. **Binary Dependencies**: These SDKs might have native bindings that don't work in Raycast's sandboxed environment
3. **Connection Management**: Complex connection pooling in some SDKs can cause the "Connection interrupted" errors

### Benefits of Current Approach

1. **Stability**: All components work reliably
2. **Performance**: REST API calls are fast and efficient
3. **Maintainability**: REST endpoints are well-documented and stable
4. **Authentication**: Uses the same GoogleAuth library for consistent auth handling

### Code Quality Improvements

- Removed all console.log statements
- Clean error handling with actionable messages
- Parallel API calls for better performance
- TypeScript types for all data structures
- Consistent UI patterns across all components

### Project Cleanup

Moved to `cleanup/` folder:
- All debug scripts
- Setup scripts
- Debug documentation
- Unnecessary files

The extension now has a clean, production-ready structure with only essential files.
